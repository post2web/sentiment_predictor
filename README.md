# Sentiment Prediction RNN with tensorflow

---

This is a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis.
Using an RNN rather than a feedfoward network is more accurate since it includes information about the *sequence* of words.
For this implementation I use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by labels.
